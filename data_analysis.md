#Statistics for Data Analysis

This is a course on data analysis, focusing on treatment of uncertainties, linear and non-linear fits, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.  It is **not** a course on statistics *per se*, and will not in general include proofs or derivations.

The course is delivered mostly through [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which are linked at the appropriate points.  If you are reading this on GitHub, the notebooks should render correctly &ndash; though at the moment the equations don't seem to be working, which is a bit of an issue! &ndash; but will not be "live": if you want to interact with them &ndash; which is the whole point &ndash; [install the necessary software](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) (it's free) and download the files (there's a "Download ZIP" button on the repository homepage).

[This](intro-prog-plot.ipynb) is a brief introductory notebook with a couple of examples to play with.

The course contains three main topics:

* [**errors and their propagation**](err-prop.md), covering basic terminology, correlated and uncorrelated errors, and error propagation;

* [**fitting functions**](fits.md), covering linear and non-linear fits and the definition of &chi;<sup>2</sup>;

* [**hypothesis testing and confidence intervals**](hyp-test.md), covering the use of &chi;<sup>2</sup> as a measure of goodness of fit, error bars in terms of &Delta;&chi;<sup>2</sup>, confidence intervals and limits.
