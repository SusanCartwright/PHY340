#Effective Teamworking

All the assessment for this half of PHY340/350 is based on work done as part of a team.  As happens out in the real world, you have been *assigned* to a team: you did not choose to work with your best mates.  You may not know all your team-mates &ndash; worse, you may know them and dislike them.  **This should not prevent you from working effectively as a team**, although it may make the initial team-building process more difficult.

Remember that team-working skills are one of the main things that employers look for when hiring graduates!  If your team works together effectively and gets high marks, that will be something to brag about on your CV &ndash; *especially* if you did not get on all that well on a personal level.

##Some key points

In order to maximise the effectiveness of your team, you will need to 

* understand each other's strengths and weaknesses;
* use that understanding to assign tasks appropriately and balance workload effectively;
* maintain good communications, including effective record-keeping;
* support each other;
* resolve internal disputes quickly and with mutual respect.

###Understand strengths and weaknesses

If the team is to work effectively, its members should be honest with each other about their strengths and weaknesses: you will not achieve your team potential if the programming task is assigned to someone who has trouble getting "Hello World" to compile, while the ace programmer (who can't spell for toffee) is stuck with editing the final report.  A good way to deal with this is for each team member to fill out a [personal SWOT analysis](Personal SWOT Analysis.docx) and share it with the rest of the team (note: this will only work if you are *honest* in filling out the form!).

###Assign tasks appropriately and balance workload effectively

Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that the team has a dictatorial leader who hands things out to his/her minions and demands that they report back by next Wednesday &ndash; it is perfectly possible for tasks to be assigned on a volunteer basis.  Likewise, an effectively balanced workload quite likely does not mean that everyone has an exactly equal share: some team members may work faster than others, and can take on a bigger task without feeling overworked, while others may have strengths that are more useful in the later stages of the task (for example, someone who is thorough and detail-minded may make an excellent code debugger or report editor, even if he or she works too slowly to contribute much to the initial brainstorming).

###Maintain good communications

Every team member needs to know who's doing what, and where they've got to: otherwise, some tasks may wind up being missed because everyone thought someone else would do them, intermediate results may not be ready when another team member needs them, two people may end up doing the same thing and then having a bitter argument about whose work makes it into the final report, and so forth.  The key to avoiding this is communication.

* Have regular meetings, and **minute them**.  The minutes need not be longwinded verbatim accounts of every word spoken, but you need to record who came (and who didn't), agreed actions and goals, and names assigned to tasks.  
* Set deadlines, and keep track of whether they are being met.  If a critical task is falling behind schedule, the team may need to allocate extra effort to it (this doesn't need to reflect badly on the person originally reponsible: maybe the task just turned out to be bigger or more difficult than it originally seemed).
* Have short progress reports from all members, even when a deadline isn't looming.  This should helpto encourage steady effort, rather than short bursts of frenetic activity.
* Talk to each other!  Especially if your assigned tasks are closely related, or if anyone feels the need for some moral &ndash; or practical &ndash; support.

MOLE provides tools to support record-keeping and discussion: the Group Discussion Board, Journal and Wiki tools could all be used for this purpose.  **Do keep your team records on MOLE**, because **this is part of the assessment**.  Any team that leaves no evidence on MOLE of effective communication and record-keeping will be marked down.

###Support each other

There are many reasons why some members of your team may need extra support.  Maybe they find team-working exceptionally difficult for some reason: they may be very shy, or on the autistic spectrum, or speaking English as a second language.  Don't just dismiss these people: they may have valuable skills to contribute; they just need a bit of support &ndash; perhaps some one-on-one meetings with another team member to act as mentor, perhaps providing written submissions to meetings instead of coming in person. A small amount of extra consideration may make a big difference to their value as part of the team.

Other team members may have bitten off more than they can chew in the initial task assignments.  Again, providing support so that the task gets done is far more constructive than just sitting back and saying "I knew they shouldn't have volunteered for that &ndash; I could have done it better."  

###Resolve internal disputes quickly and with mutual respect

There will probably be cases where team members disagree about the best way forward, or where one member is not seen as being a good colleague (not doing a fair share of the work, trying to horn in on a task that the team assigned to someone else, persistently sniping at other people's efforts, ...).  You need a way to resolve such disputes as constructively as possible: having the team fragment into subgroups that don't talk to each other is *not* the way to get the best results, and although agreeing to cold-shoulder an uncooperative colleague may be the easiest way forward, it will result in the rest of you having to do more work than you would have had if you could have worked out a way of bringing the black sheep back into the fold.  How you do this will depend on the nature of the problem, and the team's collective style, but it's something that you need to think about.

##Resources

Effective team-working is such an essential skill in business and industry that you will find literally hundreds of webpages devoted to it, most of them saying pretty much the same things.  A handy digest is the "Director's Briefing" on [Teambuilding](http://constructingexcellence.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Hr31team.pdf), from the [Constructing Excellence](http://constructingexcellence.org.uk/resources/teamworking/) site: it's written for someone who's managing a small business, but most of it still makes sense in our context.  [Meetings 101](http://www.effectivemeetings.com/meetingbasics/training.asp) from the [EffectiveMeetings.com](http://www.effectivemeetings.com/) is a useful guide to running a good meeting (warning: the first time you load a page from this site, it seems to take ages, although loading subsequent pages from the same site is OK).  There are many other websites along the same lines.
