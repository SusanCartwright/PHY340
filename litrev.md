#Finding and Retrieving Information

##Motivation

> **"A year in the laboratory can save you an hour in the library."**
> (John McMillan)

If you are planning an experiment, a literature search can 

* tell you that someone has already made the measurement you were intending to make;
* warn you that the technique you were planning to use has unforeseen drawbacks;
* give you a better understanding of your likely backgrounds;
* suggest particular avenues of investigation;
* provide input into your experiment design.

Fast, efficient retrieval of information on a particular topic is an important **transferable skill**, useful in any graduate career (not just physics).  It is particularly important, for example, in the field of product development: if you want to patent a feature of your new product, you need to carry out an extensive literature search to make sure that your feature is genuinely novel &ndash; otherwise, your patent application will be invalid on the ground of "prior art", and you/your company will have wasted a substantial amount of time and money.

##Aims

You want the information you retrieve to be

* **reliable** &ndash; information that is not reliable is obviously not useful;
* **complete** &ndash; incomplete coverage of your topic can leave you with a biased picture, or (in cases such as patent searches) fail to achieve your objectives;
* **up-to-date** &ndash; many fields of science and technology move very quickly, and information that is even a few years old might already be obsolete (and this is even more true in fields such as marketing and finance).

###Reliability

In a scientific literature search, the best guide to reliability is the **peer review system** used by **refereed journals**.  Peer review is a system whereby papers submitted to the journal are sent by the editor to one or more trusted experts in the relevant field, who will read it and provide comments.  The comments are then passed back to the author(s) of the paper, who can respond by making changes to the manuscript, by explaining why, in their view, the criticisms are incorrect, or by withdrawing the paper (and perhaps submitting it elsewhere).  Peer review is not perfect (there is [some evidence](http://blogs.nature.com/peer-to-peer/2008/01/doubleblind_peer_review_reveal.html) that male authors are treated more sympathetically than females, and referees with pronounced views on the topic of the paper are obviously more likely to approve papers that support those views), but it does weed out papers with obvious flaws.  At the opposite extreme, the reason that **references to websites are discouraged** is that the Web has no review system at all &ndash; anyone can post anything about anything, and it can be quite difficult to distinguish qualified commentators from out-and-out nutcases.

There are many, many refereed journals in physics and astrophysics: the [ADS list of abbreviations](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs_doc/refereed.html) gives some sense of the numbers.  Most specialise in particular fields, although [Nature](http://www.nature.com/) and [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/) are prestigious journals covering all aspects of science.

In the initial stages of a literature search, the order of preference is probably:

1. **a recent review article in a refereed journal** (review articles are explicitly designed to provide a balanced report of the current state of play in the topic, and are generally commissioned from a leading authority in the field);

2. **recent research papers in refereed journals** (these are the original sources of the information, and being in refereed journals have been peer-reviewed, but as each paper will cover only one small piece of the field it can be difficult to ensure that your overall coverage is complete and unbiased; also, research papers are written for specialists, and may be very difficult to read for people unfamiliar with the background and jargon of the field);

3. **very recent [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) preprints** (these are generally papers that have been submitted to refereed journals or presented at conferences &ndash; they will give the most recent results, but have not yet been peer-reviewed and are therefore less reliable);

4. **advanced textbooks or monographs from reputable publishers** (these may be easier to understand, and should be reliable, but are more likely to be out of date &ndash; the publishing process takes time, and once published books stay on library shelves forever).

###Completeness

Ensuring that your literature search is **complete** and **balanced** is very important, and quite difficult if you are not familiar with the field.  It is helpful to read at least one review article &ndash; there are journals that are devoted to review articles, such as the various [Annual Review](http://www.annualreviews.org/) titles, [Physics Reports](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/physics-reports/) and [Reports on Progress in Physics](http://iopscience.iop.org/0034-4885/).  Using keyword or title searches in addition to author-based searches in databases is also an important technique: a particular author's work is probably focused on one aspect of the field, and relying on that author and references cited by that author will therefore lead to incomplete coverage.

If you are working to a specified length, you often have the choice of broad but shallow coverage or detailed but partial coverage.  If the intended output is a literature review, broad but shallow is the way to go: your readers can follow up your references if they want more detail.  However, there may be cases in which a more in-depth look at one aspect of the field is preferable (for example, if you have been asked to give a talk or write an article on "your field" for a non-specialist audience).  If you are doing this, **say so** ("I don't have time to cover all of neutrino physics in this talk, so I'm going to focus on recent results in neutrino oscillations").

###Keeping up to date

Ensuring that your literature review is up-to-date is obviously important &ndash; if you wrote a review on the Higgs boson that didn't mention that it had been discovered, you would simply look silly.  This may be less obvious in other fields, because the recent discoveries might not be quite so headline-grabbing, but that doesn't make it untrue.  The easiest way to ensure that you are up-to-date is simply to look at the dates of your sources: if you don't have anything from the last couple of years, then unless your topic is inherently historical you probably have a problem.  The simplest solution is to do a keyword/title search in one of the online databases, looking specifically for recent articles.

##Finding information

1. If you know absolutely nothing about the topic, or very little, start by acquiring some basic background knowledge and vocabulary.  Reading the relevant section of a textbook is a good place to start.  Don't dismiss Wikipedia *as a starting point* (its technical articles are generally OK; it's the more popular topics that get vandalised), but you should not be using Wikipedia by the time you actually write your review.

2. Once you have the basic background, read a review article: the more recent, the better.  (A good place to look for review articles is the relevant [Annual Review](http://www.annualreviews.org/) &ndash; the articles can only be downloaded by subscribers, but if you are coming in from a Sheffield University computer the site should recognise the University subscription.)  This will give you more technical depth, and its reference list will give you a place to start with author-based searches of publication databases.  *If you don't understand the review article, go back to the textbooks* &ndash; review articles are usually written for people who are at least somewhat outside the field, whereas research papers are for insiders, so if you didn't understand the review article, you have little hope of getting to grips with the papers.

3. You should now have a feel for the field and, from the review article, a list of keywords and authors to look for.  You can now start mining the online databases.  *Which* online database you go for is subject-dependent: I use [adsabs](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html), which is standard practice for astronomers and seems to work well for nuclear and particle physics, but may not be as good for other branches of physics (I don't know; as I'm *not* an expert in, say, biophysics, I am not in a good position to judge its performance in that area); the University recommends Web of Science as a general starting point.  Some databases, such as **adsabs** and [arXiv]((http://arxiv.org/) are open-access; others, such as Web of Science, require a subscription (so you will need to be logged on to your University account to access them).

###Further advice

The University Library offers some [tutorials](https://librarydevelopment.group.shef.ac.uk/isr.html) on various aspects of searching for information.

##Evaluating your sources

A key stage in any literature search is **evaluating the quality of your sources**.  This is where the insistence on favouring articles in refereed journals comes in: an article on gamma-ray bursts in the *Astrophysical Journal* is far more likely to be trustworthy than a newspaper story.  However, even articles in refereed journals vary in quality, and authors have their own opinions, which may or may not reflect the consensus view of the community.  Key points are:

1. Read widely, and compare different sources.  If one author consistently says something that contradicts what all the others say, then you can be reasonably sure that that author's views are not representative of mainstream opinion.  This does not necessarily mean that they should not be mentioned in your review, but it does mean that they should not dictate your review's tone and content. 
2. Consult review articles, preferably more than one, and preferably by different authors.  Review articles *should* provide a balanced view of the field at the time of writing.  If three review articles all paint much thee same picture, then you have a clear view of the state of play, and can fit more recent articles into context.
3. Be particularly wary of theoretical papers, especially in poorly understood fields.  Theory is by its nature less constrained than experimental results, and in the case of new and poorly understood results there may be as many theories as there are theoreticians.  (For example, try doing a title search for "AMS positron excess" on **adsabs** &ndash; you only need to read the titles of the ten or so papers that come up to realise that they can't all be right, and they probably can all be wrong!)  The newer and more controversial the experimental result, the more varied and less reliable the theoretical papers claiming to explain it are likely to be.  Depending on the nature of your review article, you may attempt to summarise all the competing theories, or you may give up and say something like "Numerous attempts have been made to explain this result", followed by a set of references.  What you certainly should *not* do is take the first result (which in the above example is, as of August 2015, Chen, Chiang and Nomura, *Phys. Lett.* **B747** (2015) 495-499, a paper in a perfectly respectable refereed journal) and assume that it is the definitive explanation.
4. Also be wary of arXiv preprints that are more than a few months old, and yet have not been published (check their publication status with **adsabs** or Web of Science: although the main arXiv page for a paper includes a place to put its published reference, many authors forget to update this when the paper is published).  With some exceptions that were not intended for publication, such as write-ups of graduate school lecture notes (e.g. Boris Kayser's [Neutrino Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0506165) SLAC Summer School lectures, which while out-of-date for experimental results are still a sound introduction to the theory), any paper which is more than a year old and has not been published is likely to have failed peer review, and is therefore suspect.

###When to use web-based sources

As noted above, web-based sources are generally regarded as untrustworthy for academic purposes, because of the lack of quality control.  However, there are exceptions.

* **Professionally curated online databases**, such as the [Encyclopaedia of Extrasolar Planets](http://exoplanet.eu/): these are increasingly common and thoroughly reliable.  They usually have identifiable academic editors or institutional sponsors (e.g. NASA) and provide references to the academic literature for the data that they contain.  If in doubt, ask an appropriate academic (i.e. one who works in the field: I can be trusted on astrophysics and particle physics, but not on semiconductors, for example!).

* **Websites belonging to experiments or space missions**, such as the [T2K public webpage](http://t2k-experiment.org/) or the [*Chandra* web page](http://chandra.si.edu/).  These are maintained by the members of the collaboration or by the sponsoring body.  They are particularly useful as sources of images and as places to look for publications: collaboration websites will almost invariably have a "Publications" page with links to all their papers.  

* **University research group web pages** are not in general useful as primary sources, but again will often have links to relevant publications.

##Using your sources

A good literature review is **not** a series of summaries of research papers: it is a coherent, balanced picture of the state of the field.  The key steps are:

1. **Assimilate** the information &ndash; you need to *understand* the content of the paper.  You are not going to be able to use the information successfully if you do not know what it means.

2. **Analyse** and **evaluate** your sources &ndash; what is the consensus view within the field?  Are there pieces that don't fit?  What are the unanswered questions and hot topics?  In what direction is the field moving?

3. **Synthesise** the information into a coherent narrative.  Combine related information from different sources &ndash; for example, Higgs results from ATLAS and CMS.  Recognise contradictions &ndash; for example, the results of dark matter searches by DAMA/LIBRA and by LUX &ndash; and decide how to present them: does one side have much wider acceptance than the other, or is this a live controversy with reputable authorities on both sides?  Construct an introduction, explaining the motivation and background of the study, and a conclusion.

##Citing your sources

Any information in a report or paper that is **not your own original work** should be **referenced**.  The in-text reference should appear **at the point where the information is used** (not, for example, at the end of the paragraph): the relationship between source and information should be clear to the reader.  In physics and astrophysics, there are two standard styles of in-text citation in widespread use: the Harvard style, where the citation is to the author's name and the publication date (Bloggs 2015), and various numeric styles, where the citation is a number, either bracketed [1] or superscripted<sup>1</sup>.  Each journal has a "house style", and papers published in that journal will all follow that style (text processors such as LaTeX that use symbolic referencing can be configured to produce the right style without having to edit the text of the document).  For student papers, Harvard style is easiest if you are inserting your references by hand, because in Harvard style the references are listed in alphabetical order, so if you suddenly decide you need to insert a new reference in the first paragraph you don't have to renumber every subsequent reference (in numerical styles, references are listed in order of appearance in the text).  If you are using a symbolic tool to insert your references, it doesn't matter which style you use, although in scientific work it is safest to stay away from superscripts (which can be misinterpreted if attached to a number).

**Figure sources** should be cited **in the figure caption** (even if they are also cited in the text): many readers look at the pictures before/instead of reading the entire paper.  Note that there is nothing special about figure sources: they are sources just like any other, and should be included in the general list of references.

In the actual list of references, the key point is that you need to provide all the information that the reader needs in order to find the source.  For papers in refereed journals, this is the author(s) (or first author et al. for papers with more than three or four authors), the journal title (usually abbreviated), the volume number, the year, and the page or article identifier. (Note that the title of the paper, though often given, is *not* essential: many papers have very similar titles, but the journal name, volume and page is unique.)  **Note that even if you found the paper online, the correct reference is to its journal publication, not to the URL you downloaded it from**: this is because of the higher status of papers published in refereed journals, and also because URLs may change whereas traditional journal references are permanent.  There is, however, an increasing tendency to include online references as supplements to the main reference.

More details on referencing can be found in the relevant [online tutorials](http://www.librarydevelopment.group.shef.ac.uk/referencing.html) &ndash; there is one for Harvard style and one for AIP style (a typical numeric style).  (Note for non-Sheffield readers: these are probably not accessible to you, but there are many universities with more sensible access policies: [Monash University](http://guides.lib.monash.edu/citing-referencing/home) has a handy page with drop-down menus for common styles, including Harvard and AIP.)
