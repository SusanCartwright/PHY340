##Jupyter notebooks for PHY340/350 Professional Skills in Physics and Astronomy

This repository contains the resources for part 1 of Sheffield University Department of Physics and Astronomy's course on professional skills for physicists and astronomers.  This part of the course has three main themes:

* [**Team-working skills.**](teamworking.md)  Students will work in teams of about 6 people.  Effective teamwork will be vital in achieving the goals of the course.

* [**Information retrieval skills.**](litrev.md)  Teams will be asked to carry out a search of the research literature relevant to a particular problem.  Assessment will be based on a short report.

* **Data analysis skills.** Following the literature review, teams will be required to carry out a data analysis task which will make use of the material covered in lectures and contained in this repository.
